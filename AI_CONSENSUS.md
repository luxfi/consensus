# AI Consensus Architecture

## Overview

The Lux blockchain features a revolutionary AI-powered consensus mechanism that enables autonomous, intelligent, and evolutionary node behavior. This system allows nodes to:

- Make intelligent decisions using embedded LLMs
- Learn and evolve from network behavior
- Form autonomous relationships with other nodes
- Participate in decentralized governance
- Fund their own computation on-chain

## Architecture Components

### 1. Neural Consensus (`ai_consensus_impl.go`)

A pure neural network implementation featuring:
- **3 Specialized Neural Networks**:
  - Proposal Network (100→64→32): Optimizes block proposals
  - Validation Network (64→32→2): Validates blocks with confidence scores
  - Consensus Network (128→64→1): Predicts consensus outcomes

- **Key Features**:
  - Xavier weight initialization for stable training
  - ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
  - Validator behavior prediction
  - Deep validation fallback for low-confidence decisions
  - Historical learning from consensus events

### 2. LLM Consensus (`llm_consensus.go`)

Advanced consensus with embedded language models:
- **Embedded LLM Integration**: Each node runs its own LLM for reasoning
- **Evolutionary Capabilities**:
  - Genetic algorithms for parameter optimization
  - Mutation and crossover between successful nodes
  - Fitness-based evolution
- **DAO Governance**: LLM-analyzed proposals with automatic voting
- **Node Relationships**: Autonomous peer/partner/competitor relationships
- **Value Exchange**: Knowledge and resource sharing between nodes
- **Cross-Chain Sovereignty**: Support for sovereign coins and bridges

### 3. Multi-Backend Engine (`ai_engine.go`)

Flexible backend system supporting:
- **Go Backend**: Pure Go implementation
- **C/C++ Backend**: High-performance native code
- **MLX Backend**: Apple Silicon ML acceleration
- **CUDA Backend**: NVIDIA GPU acceleration
- **WASM Backend**: WebAssembly for browser nodes
- **Hybrid Mode**: Automatic backend switching based on workload

## Configuration

### Basic Neural Consensus

```go
nc := consensus.NewNeuralConsensus()
```

### LLM Consensus with Custom Model

```go
config := &consensus.LLMConfig{
    ModelPath:     "/models/lux-7b.gguf",
    ModelSize:     7_000_000_000, // 7B parameters
    ContextWindow: 4096,
    Quantization:  "int8",
}
llm := consensus.NewLLMConsensus(config)
```
