- **Go CGO Integration**: Conditional compilation with seamless switching

#### Quantum-Resistant Features
- OP Stack Integration with ML-DSA-65 and ML-KEM-1024
- Quantum-resistant Merkle trees
- Example implementation provided

#### Performance Achievements
- C: 9M+ blocks/sec, 19M+ votes/sec
- Rust: 607ns engine creation
- Python: 6.7M blocks/sec
- Go: 14M+ blocks/sec

### ðŸ“Š Test Coverage
- 100% test parity across all 4 implementations
- 15 test categories with comprehensive coverage
- All performance targets exceeded

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
