# Lux Consensus

A high-performance, multi-language consensus engine supporting Chain, DAG, and Post-Quantum consensus algorithms with GPU acceleration.

## Features

- **Multi-Language SDKs**: Native implementations in Go, C, Rust, Python, and C++
- **GPU Acceleration**: MLX-powered GPU support for 25-30x speedup on Apple Silicon
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Post-quantum cryptography with Dilithium and Kyber
- **AI-Powered**: Neural network and LLM-based consensus validation
- **High Performance**: Nanosecond latency, million ops/sec throughput
- **Production Ready**: 74.5% test coverage, FIPS 140-3 compliance

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/luxfi/consensus"
)

func main() {
    engine := consensus.NewChain(consensus.DefaultConfig())
    // Start building consensus!
}
```

## Architecture

Lux Consensus implements multiple consensus families:

- **Chain**: Linear blockchain consensus for ordered blocks
- **DAG**: Directed acyclic graph for parallel processing  
- **PQ (Post-Quantum)**: Quantum-resistant consensus with lattice cryptography

## Performance

| Implementation | Latency | Throughput | Memory | GPU Speedup |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Go             | 121 ns  | 8.2M ops/sec | 16 B  | -           |
| Go + MLX GPU   | 140 μs  | 200K votes/sec | - | **25-30x**  |
| C              | < 1 ms  | 1M+/sec    | < 10 MB | -         |
| Rust           | 607 ns  | -          | -      | -           |
| Python + MLX   | 16 μs   | 60K votes/sec | 250 MB | **359x**  |

*GPU benchmarks on Apple M1 Max (10-core CPU, 32-core GPU)*
