# Lux Consensus

A high-performance, multi-language consensus engine supporting Chain, DAG, and Post-Quantum consensus algorithms.

## Features

- **Multi-Language SDKs**: Native implementations in Go, C, Rust, Python, and C++
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Post-quantum cryptography with Dilithium and Kyber
- **AI-Powered**: Neural network and LLM-based consensus validation
- **High Performance**: Microsecond latency, million ops/sec throughput
- **Production Ready**: 74.5% test coverage, comprehensive benchmarks

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/luxfi/consensus/engine/core"
)

func main() {
    engine := core.NewChain(core.DefaultConfig())
    // Start building consensus!
}
```

## Architecture

Lux Consensus implements multiple consensus families:

- **Chain**: Linear blockchain consensus for ordered blocks
- **DAG**: Directed acyclic graph for parallel processing  
- **PQ (Post-Quantum)**: Quantum-resistant consensus with lattice cryptography

## Performance

| Implementation | Latency | Throughput | Memory |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------|
| Go             | 1.5 μs  | 660K/sec   | 912 B  |
| C              | < 1 ms  | 1M+/sec    | < 10 MB |
| Rust           | 607 ns  | -          | -      |
