## Key Observations

1. **Heavy Utility Dependencies**: The consensus package heavily relies on utility packages from the node, especially data structures like `set`, `bag`, and various math/timing utilities.

2. **Validator Management**: Strong coupling with validator management (32 occurrences), which makes sense for consensus but creates a dependency.

3. **Protocol Dependencies**: Dependencies on protobuf definitions and message handling infrastructure.

4. **Infrastructure Coupling**: Dependencies on metrics, health checks, and subnet management indicate tight coupling with node infrastructure.

## Dependencies That Need Resolution

To make the consensus package truly standalone, the following dependencies need to be addressed:

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Validators** - Need to define interfaces or move validator management into consensus
2. **Protocol/Message** - Need to extract protocol definitions or create interfaces
3. **Version** - Version management should be abstracted

### Medium Priority (Utilities)
1. **Data Structures** (`set`, `bag`, `bimap`, etc.) - Could be moved to a shared utility package
2. **Math/Timing Utilities** - Could be extracted to a common utilities package
3. **Cache** - Interface could be defined in consensus with implementations elsewhere

### Lower Priority (Infrastructure)
1. **Metrics/Health** - Could be abstracted through interfaces
2. **Subnets** - Need to understand if this is truly needed in consensus
3. **VM-specific dependencies** - Should be abstracted or removed

## Recommendations

1. **Create a shared utilities package** that both consensus and node can depend on
2. **Define interfaces in consensus** for external dependencies (validators, messaging, etc.)
3. **Extract protocol definitions** to a separate package
4. **Remove or abstract VM-specific dependencies**
5. **Consider moving validator interfaces** into the consensus package since they're fundamental to consensus
